Some of the most relevant GAN pros and cons for the are:  
- They currently generate the sharpest images  
- They are easy to train (since no statistical inference is required), and only back-propogation is needed to obtain gradients  
- GANs are difficult to optimize due to unstable training dynamics.  
- No statistical inference can be done with them (except here): GANs belong to the class of direct implicit density models; they model p(x) without explicitly defining the p.d.f.  

### Understanding a GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks are composed of two models:  
- The first model is called a Generator and it aims to generate new data similar to the expected one. The Generator could be asimilated to a human art forger, which creates fake works of art.  
- The second model is named the Discriminator. This model’s goal is to recognize if an input data is ‘real’ — belongs to the original dataset — or if it is ‘fake’ — generated by a forger. In this scenario, a Discriminator is analogous to the police (or an art expert), which tries to detect artworks as truthful or fraud.  
   
The Generator (forger) needs to learn how to create data in such a way that the Discriminator isn’t able to distinguish it as fake anymore. The competition between these two teams is what improves their knowledge, until the Generator succeeds in creating realistic data.
